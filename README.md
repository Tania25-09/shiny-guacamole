➤ What’s a Prompt?
A prompt is just a message or question we give to AI. The better I phrase it, the smarter and more helpful the answer becomes. Like magic—but logical.

➤ Instruction Prompt
This type is simple and direct. I just tell the AI what to do, like “Translate this to Hindi” or “Summarize this paragraph.” Straightforward and super useful.

➤ Role Play Prompt
Here, I ask the AI to pretend—like “Act like a doctor” or “Be a career advisor.” It helps me get responses in a specific voice or role.

➤ Few-Shot Prompt
In few-shot, I show a few examples before asking my question. It’s like training the AI on the spot. Really helps with getting consistent outputs.

➤ Zero-Shot Prompt
In zero-shot, I just ask the question directly, with no examples. It works if the question is clear. Great for quick queries or fact-based stuff.

➤ Chain of Thought Prompt
This one guides the AI to think step by step. Like solving a puzzle together. I give it room to explain its reasoning. Super helpful in logic-based tasks.

➤ Constraint-Based Prompt
I give rules like “Write in 100 words” or “Use only simple English.” Makes the AI more controlled and focused in its answers.

➤ Reframing Prompt
Sometimes just rewording the question helps. Instead of “Tell me a story,” I say “Tell me a bedtime story for a 5-year-old.” Totally changes the output tone.

➤ Prompt Writing Formula
The formula I noted down:
[Instruction] + [Context] + [Format] + [Constraints] [Role] = Powerful Prompt


➤ Real-World Uses
These prompts are used in coding, resume writing, script writing, teaching, e-commerce,chatbots . It’s a skill that applies everywhere!

➤ Common Prompt Mistakes
Biggest one? Being vague or too broad. Like asking “Tell me something” or “Write a good paragraph.” The AI doesn’t know what I really want then.

➤ Tools for Prompt Engineers
I bookmarked some tools today: ChatGPT (obviously), PromptHero (for prompt ideas), and OpenAI Playground to experiment more.
